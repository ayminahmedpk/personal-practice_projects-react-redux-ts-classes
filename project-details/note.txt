The reducer and redux code has been significantly simplified in 0.1.4

Instead of specifying type constants in a separate file and importing them,
which caused TS many issues and resulted in may extra type assertions and type
guards needed just to get things working,

the better solution was to simply define string constants as the type of the
'type' parameters of the relevant actions, and let TS do the verification for us
later on in the reducer function and elsewhere.

As a result, we get validation of the strings in the reducer switch case, (just
press ctrl+space in front of a new case to inspect the options), and based on
the chosen (or entered) case, TS already knows whether there is a payload or
not, and also knows the type of the payload.

The code is much cleaner and is more replicable - and actually possible to
follow.
